How long did you spend working on this project?
2 days

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Re-opening the String class, then using the send method and :define_method to create the color methods

Where do you still have room to grow?
Meta-programming will probably require a lot more practice, and I will need to find or create a suitable project to use it
